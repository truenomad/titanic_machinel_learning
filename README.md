# Titanic - Machine learning from disaster


#### -- Project Status: [Completed]


This project is part of [Kaggle data science competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

## Project Intro

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this project, we will predict the sorts of people who were likely to survive within the Titanic. Our main objective is to apply machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

## Project Description
In order to predict the outcome of the passengers in the titanic, we first need explore the data. Clean and impute data. Engineer features for prediction. Then finally apply a classifcation model on the data.

## Needs of this project

- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- data imputation
- statistical modeling - machine learninig - random forest
- writeup/reporting

## Getting Started
